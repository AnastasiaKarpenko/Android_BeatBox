# BeatBox

BeatBox is not a box for musical beats. It is a box that helps you beat people up. 
It helps with the hard part: yelling in a manner calculated to frighten your opponent into submission.

In this project I learned:
- Data binding library and Model-View-ViewModel architechture
- Unit testing with Mockito and Hamcrest
- Audio playback
- Modifying styles and themes
- Creating custom drawables (shape drawables, state list drawables, layer list drawables
